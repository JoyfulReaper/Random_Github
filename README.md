Random Github
============
A re-creation of an old C++ project I did quite some time ago. Re-done the right way using C# and WinForms this time.

Be amazed by all the empty repos, forks with nothing changed, misuses of git, and bad code you will find using this amazing program!

GitHub API only allowes 50 API calls if you are not authorized. You can use your personal access token to get 5000 API calls. Go to your GitHub Settings, then Developer Settings, then Personal Access tokens to create one. Then put this information in the appsettings.json file to make this much more useful. It can take more than one API call to find a random repo.
